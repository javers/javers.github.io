released on 2023-09-16
* [1324](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1324)
  Fix in the `javers-spring-boot-starter-mongo` config that prevents the Spring Boot exception:
  Field mongoProperties in `org.javers.spring.boot.mongo.JaversMongoAutoConfiguration` required a bean of type 'org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mongo.MongoProperties' that could not be found.

### 7.3.2
released on 2023-08-09
* [1314](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1314)

  Fixed WriteConflict when using transactional MongoRepository.
  Writing to the `head_id` collection is now skipped when RANDOM commitId generator is selected.
  The fix requires enabling the RANDOM CommitId generator. RANDOM CommitId generator
  should always be used when multiple instances of Javers write to the same database.

  ```yaml
  javers:
    commitIdGenerator: random
  ```
  
### 7.2.0
released on 2023-07-16

          EntityDefinitionBuilder.entityDefinition(MyEntity.class)
                  .withShallowProperties(["myShallowProperty"])
                  .build())
          .build()
  ```

### 7.1.0
released on 2023-07-12
* [1300](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1300)

released on 2023-07-11
* [1287](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1287)
  Fixed bug in interpreting the `@DiffIgnoreProperties` annotation.

### 7.0.2
released on 2023-07-09
* [1213](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1213)

### <font color="red">7.0.0</font>
released on 2023-04-24

[1238](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1238)
**Added compatibility with Spring Boot 3.0.** <br/>
<font color="red"><b>Time to say goodbye to our beloved Java 8.</b></font>
<br/>
Spring Boot 3.0 has moved forward and is **no longer compatible with Java 8**.
Now, Spring Boot 3.0 requires Java 17 &mdash; so we all need to catch up.

Since Javers 7.0, all Javers Spring integration modules require Java 17:
* `javers-spring`
* `javers-spring-jpa`
* `javers-spring-mongo`
* `javers-spring-boot-starter-mongo`
* `javers-spring-boot-starter-sql`

Javers core and Javers persistence modules require Java 11:
* `javers-core`
* `javers-persistence-mongo`
* `javers-persistence-sql`:

**The last version of Javers that is compatible with Java 8 and Spring Boot 2 is
6.14.0**.<br/> We strongly recommend to upgrade to Javers 7.x.
You can still use Javers 6.14.0, but the 6.x line is frozen and no longer supported.

**Migration from Javers 6.x to Javers 7.x**<br/>
* No actions required from the Javer's perspective.
* A friendly reminder if you are upgrading to Java 17 &mdash;
  the built-in `javax.persistence` package disappeared 
  and should be replaced with the `jakarta.persistence` package from `jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:3.0.0`.

### 6.14.0
released on 2023-03-31
* [1230](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1230)
  Fixed bug in JaversBuilder.
  Scanned classes were ignoring custom value comparators for their properties.

### 6.13.0
released on 2023-03-22
* [1252](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1252)
  The internal GSON config is tuned to better map numeric values with Object type.

### 6.12.0
released on 2023-03-17
* [1257](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1257)
  Added option for implementing application-Layer encryption of 
  Snapshot State in SQL repository.
  See usage in [Case1257ApplicationLayerEncryption.groovy](https://github.com/javers/javers/blob/master/javers-persistence-sql/src/test/groovy/org/javers/repository/sql/cases/Case1257ApplicationLayerEncryption.groovy)

### 6.10.0
released on 2023-02-17
* [1254](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1260)
  Added possibility to disable the schema management in Mongo Repository. Usage:
  ```Java
        MongoRepository mongoRepository = new MongoRepository(getMongoDb(),
                mongoRepositoryConfiguration()
                        .withSchemaManagementEnabled(false)
                        .build())
  
    ```

  See also [MongoE2EWithSchemaEnabledTest.groovy](https://github.com/javers/javers/blob/master/javers-persistence-mongo/src/test/groovy/org/javers/repository/mongo/MongoE2EWithSchemaEnabledTest.groovy)

* [1261](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/1261)
  Added possibility to set Mongo Repository parameters: 
  `snapshotCollectionName`, `headCollectionName`, and `schemaManagementEnabled`
  via Spring boot configuration. 

  Example usage in `application.yml:
  
  ```yaml
    javers:
      snapshotCollectionName: "jv_custom_snapshots"
      headCollectionName: "jv_custom_head_id"
      schemaManagementEnabled: false
  ```

### 7.0.0-RC3
released on 2023-02-03

* RC for 7.0.0

### 6.9.1
released on 2023-02-01
* [1254](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1254)
  Added possibility to customize the HEAD collection name in MongoRepository.

  Usage:
  ```Java
        MongoRepository mongoRepository = new MongoRepository(getMongoDb(),
                        mongoRepositoryConfiguration()
                                .withSnapshotCollectionName("jv_custom_snapshots")
                                .withHeadCollectionName("jv_custom_head_id")
                                .build())
  ```
  
  See also [MongoE2EWithCustomHeadCollectionNameTest.groovy](https://github.com/javers/javers/blob/master/javers-persistence-mongo/src/test/groovy/org/javers/repository/mongo/MongoE2EWithCustomHeadCollectionNameTest.groovy)

### 6.8.2
released on 2023-01-02
* Dependencies aligned with Spring Boot 2.7.7:

```groovy
springVersion           =5.3.24
springBootVersion       =2.7.7
springDataCommonsVersion=2.7.6
springDataMongoVersion  =3.4.6
springSecurityVersion   =5.7.6
mongoDbDriverVersion    =4.6.1
hibernateVersion        =5.6.14.Final
guavaVersion            =31.0-jre
gsonVersion             =2.9.0
classgraphVersion       =4.8.128
```

* In tests, `flapdoodle` Embedded MongoDB
  is replaced with `testcontainers` dockerized MongoDB.

### 6.8.1
released on 2022-12-24
* [1168](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1168)
  Fixed bug related to H2 version 2.0.204.

  for Author and Commit Properties.

### 6.7.1
released on 2022-10-02
* [1222](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/1222)
  Fixed validation in `QueryParamsBuilder`.

### 6.7.0
released on 2022-09-11
* [1216](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1216)
  Added a new switch in the diff algorithm: `usePrimitiveDefaults`.  
  This switch affects how initial and terminal Value Changes
  are calculated in the situation when a primitive property with a default value
  appears (or disappears) in an object graph. See `JaversBuilder.withUsePrimitiveDefaults()`.

### 6.6.5
released on 2022-04-18
* [1200](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1200) Fixed `InaccessibleObjectException`
  on Java 16 for `TimeZone`, `ZoneRules`, and `ZoneId`.

### 6.6.4
released on 2022-04-10
* [1192](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1192)
  Fixed important performance issue for MongoDB. Indexes on the Snapshots collection were
  not created by the [Javers Spring Boot starter](https://javers.org/documentation/spring-boot-integration/#get-javers-starters) for MongoDB.  
  This bug was introduced in 6.5.1.
  It's enough to upgrade to the latest version and the
  indexes will be automatically created.  

### 6.6.3
released on 2022-03-06
* [1188](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1188)
  Fixed exception `NoClassDefFoundError` `LinkedHashTreeMap`  
  when Javers was used with Gson 2.9.0.

### 6.6.1
released on 2022-01-26

* [1177](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/1177)
  Added possibility to register `JaversBuilderPlugin`s
  in Javers' Spring Boot Starters.
  Thanks to that, you can easily call any JaversBuilder method and for example, register a `CustomValueComparator`:

  ```java
  @Bean
  JaversBuilderPlugin javersBuilderPlugin() {
      return builder -> builder
          .registerValue(BigDecimal.class, new CustomBigDecimalComparator(2));
  }
  ```

  See the full test case in this PR: [https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/1177/files](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/1177/files).

  Added possibility to configure the name of the Snapshot collection in MongoDB.
  See [MongoE2EWithCustomCollectionNameTest.groovy](https://github.com/javers/javers/blob/master/javers-persistence-mongo/src/test/groovy/org/javers/repository/mongo/MongoE2EWithCustomCollectionNameTest.groovy).

### 6.5.3
released on 2021-12-04

* [1157](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1157)
  Fixed bug when comparing nested sets of Value Objects.

### 6.5.2
released on 2021-11-23

* [1160](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1160)
  Fixed `IllegalStateException` when calling `Changes.groupByCommit()` created by `Javers.compare()`.
  
* [1075](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1075)
  Added a new feature which allows `CustomValueComparators` to handle nulls:
  
```java
public interface CustomValueComparator<T> {
 
  ...

  /**
   * This flag is used to indicate to Javers whether
   * a comparator implementation wants to handle nulls.
   *
   * By default, the flag is false and Javers
   * checks if both values are non-null before calling a comparator.
   * If any of given values is null &mdash; Javers compares them using the
   * standard Java logic:
   *   * null == null
   *   * null != non-null
   *
   * If the flag is true &mdash; Javers skips that logic and
   * allows a comparator to handle nulls on its own.
   * In that case, a comparator holds responsibility for null-safety.
   *
   * @see NullAsBlankStringComparator
   */
  default boolean handlesNulls() {
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 6.5.1

* [1137](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1137)
  Important new feature in MongoRepository.
  Added support for MongoDB
  multi-document ACID transactions introduced in MongoDB 4.0
  and implemented in Spring Data MongoDB 2.1.

  See [Spring Boot integration](/documentation/spring-boot-integration/#Javers-MongoDB-Repository),
  [MongoDB transactions support](/documentation/spring-integration/#mongo-transactions).

  Minor breaking change: the `TransactionalJaversBuilder` class is renamed to 
  `TransactionalJpaJaversBuilder`.

* [1121](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1121)
  Fixed `IllegalArgumentException` when querying for object
  with solely TERMINAL snapshot.
  
* Dependencies aligned with Spring Boot 2.5.5:
  
```groovy
springVersion           =5.3.10
springBootVersion       =2.5.5
springDataCommonsVersion=2.5.5
springDataMongoVersion  =3.2.5
springSecurityVersion   =5.5.2
mongoDbDriverVersion    =4.2.3
hibernateVersion        =5.4.32.Final
guavaVersion            =31.0-jre

  querying on a commit property with multiple values using "IN" semantics.
  Usage:

```groovy
def "should query for entity with commit properties IN list"() {
  given:
  javers.commit('author', new SnapshotEntity(id: 1, intProperty: 2), [name: 'Steve'])
  javers.commit('author', new SnapshotEntity(id: 1, intProperty: 3), [name: 'John'])

  when:
  def snapshots = javers.findSnapshots(byInstanceId(1, SnapshotEntity)
          .withCommitPropertyIn('name', ['Steve', 'Bill'])
          .build())

  then:
  snapshots.size() == 1
  snapshots[0].getPropertyValue("intProperty") == 2
}
```

### 6.4.0
released on 2021-10-16
* [1094](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1094)
  Provided access to old and new Collection, Array, and Map values
  within `CollectionChange`, `ArrayChange`, and `MapChange` types. For example:
  
```groovy
def "should provide old and new Collection in Changes loaded from Repository" () {
    given:
    def s = new SnapshotEntity(id:1, listOfIntegers : [1,2])
    javers.commit('author', s)
    
    s.listOfIntegers = [2,4]
    javers.commit('author', s)

    when:
    def changes = javers.findChanges(byInstanceId(1, SnapshotEntity).build())
    println(changes.prettyPrint())

    then:
    ListChange change = changes[0]
    change.left instanceof List
    change.left == [1,2]
    change.right instanceof List
    change.right == [2,4]
}
```

          Map<String, List<Person>> map
    }
```
  
  Since this version, these structures are fully supported. 
  
### 6.2.5
released on 2021-09-05
* [1134](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1134)
  Fixed compatibility issue with the latest Hibernate version 5.6.0.beta1.

* [1130](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1130)

### 6.2.4
released on 2021-08-24
* [1096](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1096) 
  added `withCommitPropertyLike()` 
  method to query for commit properties with `LIKE` operator.
  
```groovy
@Unroll

  for example:

```java
@JaversAuditableConditionalDelete
List<DummyEntity> deleteByName(String name) {
    ...
}
```

or

```java
@JaversAuditableConditionalDelete
DummyEntity deleteById(String id) {
    ...
}
```

* [1055](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1055)
  Fixed `MalformedJsonException` on Oracle.

### 6.0.1
released on 2021-04-07

[1082](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/1082/files) Changes in Spring dependencies management. <br/> 
In order to lower the risk of versions clash between 
dependencies required by Javers' and dependencies required by an application (you),
all Spring dependencies in Javers' artifacts are marked as optional.
  
It means that Spring and Spring Boot versions are now managed 
only by an application:

`javers-spring-boot-starter-mongo` dependencies:

```groovy
    optional "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb:$springBootVersion"
    optional "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-configuration-processor:$springBootVersion"
```

`javers-spring-boot-starter-sql` dependencies:

```groovy
    optional "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa:$springBootVersion"
    optional "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-configuration-processor:$springBootVersion"
```

### <font color="red">6.0.0</font>
released on 2021-04-05

**Javers 6.0 comes with the important upgrade of the diff algorithm:**

We have redesigned the Javers' core algorithm &mdash; the object diff.
Now, it gives better, more meaningful, and consistent results in
both `Javers.compare()` and `Javers.findChanges()`.

The new approach improves the diff results for New and Removed Objects
thanks to the explicitly modeled and unified concepts of **Initial** and **Terminal** Changes.

Now, Javers generates additional set of **Initial Changes** for each
property of a New Object to capture its state.
Internally, Javers calculates Initial Changes by comparing a virtual, totally empty object
with a real New Object.

Symmetrically, additional set of **Terminal Changes** is generated
for each property of a Removed Object.

For example, consider the case when a Value Object is added:

```groovy
def diff = javers.compare(
    new Employee(id: "1", address: null),
    new Employee(id: "1", address: new Address(street: "x", city:"Paris"))
)

println diff.prettyPrint()
```

Javers **5.x** calculates a diff
without information about the state of the new Address:

```
Diff:
* new object: org.javers.core.Sample$Employee/1#address
* changes on org.javers.core.Sample$Employee/1 :
  - 'address' reference changed from '' to '...Sample$Employee/1#address'
```

Javers **6.x** calculates the essentially better diff:
```
Diff:
* changes on org.javers.core.NewObjectChangesE2ETest$Employee/1 :
  - 'address.city' = 'Paris'
  - 'address.street' = 'x'
```

So, in Javers 6.0, Value Objects (like `Address`) are treated more like containers for nested properties
owned by Entities and less like objects with their own indentity and type.

Calculating Initial and Terminal Changes is enabled by default.
You can disable it using `JaversBuilder.withTerminalChanges()`
and `JaversBuilder.withInitialChanges()`,

or in `application.yml`, if you are using Javers Spring Boot:

 <pre>
 javers:
   initialChanges: false
   terminalChanges: false
 </pre>

See the [Initial Changes example](/documentation/jql-examples/#initial-changes-filter).<br/>
See `JaversBuilder.withInitialChanges()` javadoc.

**All features and improvements added in Javers 6.0**

* [822](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/822)
  Fixed **problem with paging** in Shadow queries.
  <br/>
  Now, `QueryBuilder.skip()` and `QueryBuilder,limit()` works intuitively in both `Javers.findShadows()`
  and `Javers.findShadowsAndStream()`.
  <br/>Both query methods are unified and generate the same results
  (now, `findShadows()` is only the facade for `findShadowsAndStream()`).
  <br/>
  See the [Limit example](/documentation/jql-examples/#limit-filter).
  and `QueryBuilder.limit()` javadoc.

* More pretty and concise `Changes.prettyPrint()`,
  see the [changelog example](/documentation/repository-examples/#change-log).<br/>

* The new `Changes.devPrint()` method for printing Changes in a technical style.

* New or removed Value Objects no longer generate
  `NewObject`, `ObjectRemoved`, nor `ReferenceChange`.
  These changes were considered rather useless.
  Instead, a state of a new or removed Value Object
  is captured by Initial and Terminal Changes.

* New or removed Entities always generate `NewObject`/`ObjectRemoved` changes (it can't be disabled).

* The `javers.newObjectSnapshot` flag is renamed to `javers.initialChanges` and it's enabled by default.

* The `javers.terminalChanges` flag is added, and it's enabled by default.

* In `Javers.findChanges()`, a `NewObject` change is always generated for each initial Snapshot,
  it can't be disabled by the `javers.initialChanges` flag.

* The `QueryBuilder.withNewObjectChanges()` method is deprecated and has no effect.

* [911](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/911) Minor bug fixed, this WARNING
  is no longer shown: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred.

* [1077](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/1077)
  Added support for Composite Id with the `IdClass` annotation.

        .registerIgnoredClassesStrategy(c -> c.getName().startsWith("com.ignore.me"))
        .build();                       
```

### 5.10.5
released on 2020-07-16
* [941](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/941)
  Added configuration for customizing Javers' table names in SQL repository.

### <font color="red">5.10.0</font>
released on 2020-06-15

** <font color='red'>Important warning for Spring Boot MongoDB users!</font>**

This version of Javers has all dependencies aligned with Spring Boot MongoDB 2.3.0
which has upgraded to MongoDB Java Drivers 4.x.
Unfortunately, Mongo Drivers 4.x has a lot of problematic and braking changes,
especially renaming `com.mongodb.MongoClient` to `com.mongodb.client.MongoClient`
(see [mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.0/upgrading](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.0/upgrading/))
.

If you have explicit dependency to `org.mongodb:mongo-java-driver:3.x` &mdash; remove it
and rely on Mongo 4.x drivers provided by a Spring Boot MongoDB starter.

If you are using old Spring Boot version 
(2.1 or older) &mdash; you need to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.3.0,
otherwise you will probably experience versions clash between your Spring Boot version,
and the Spring Boot version imported by the Javers starter.   

* [982](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/982)
Fixed issue with `MongoClient` on on Spring Boot 2.3.0.

Dependencies aligned with Spring Boot 2.3.0:

```txt

* [981](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/981)
Added `@Arder(0)` annotation to all Javers' aspects.
This change allows users to execute their own aspects before
or after Javers' aspects (by choosing positive ot negative order numbers).
  
### 5.9.1
released on 2020-05-26
* [973](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/973)
Fixed strange bug in Gradle build: `index 9730 out of bounds for length 8192`
caused probably by `classgraph 4.8.66`.

### 5.9.0
released on 2020-05-03
* [962](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/962)
Changes in dedicated Mongo database configuration in 
[JaVers Spring Boot starter for MongoDB](/documentation/spring-boot-integration/#starter-repository-configuration).
Additional client's properties (like SSL or timeouts)
should now be provided using the new `MongoClientSettings` API
(instead of deprecated `MongoClientOptions` API). For example:

```java
@Bean("javersMongoClientSettings")
public MongoClientSettings clientSettings() {
    return MongoClientSettings.builder()
            .applyToSslSettings(builder -> builder.enabled(true))
            .applyToSocketSettings(
                builder -> builder.connectTimeout(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
            .build();
}
```

### 5.8.13
released on 2020-04-07
* [948](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/948)
  Better support for properties with unknown types (with type tokens), like:
  
```java
class Pair<L, R> {
        L left;
        R right;
}
```  

* All JaVersâ€™ dependencies are bumped to the latest versions:

### 5.8.12
released on 2020-03-31
* [951](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/951)
  Dependencies management fix in `javers-core`. Guava and joda-time
  are now correctly marked as optional in `pom.xml`.

### 5.8.11
released on 2020-03-08
* [915](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/915)
  Added **experimental** asynchronous audit aspect for non Spring Data repositories.
  The aspect asynchronously commits all arguments passed to methods annotated with
  `@JaversAuditableAsync` annotation
  by calling `Javers.commitAsync(String, Object, Executor)`.
  
Usage:   
  
```java
@Repository
class DummyAuditedAsyncRepository {

    @JaversAuditableAsync
    void save(DummyObject obj){
      //... omitted
    }
}
```

Spring config:

```java
/**
 * Enables asynchronous auto-audit aspect for ordinary repositories.<br/>
 *
 * Use {@link JaversAuditableAsync}
 * to mark repository methods that you want to audit.
 */
@Bean
public JaversAuditableAspectAsync javersAuditableAspectAsync() {
    return new JaversAuditableAspectAsync(javers(), authorProvider(), commitPropertiesProvider(), javersAsyncAuditExecutor());
}

@Bean
public ExecutorService javersAsyncAuditExecutor() {
    ThreadFactory threadFactory = new ThreadFactoryBuilder()
            .setNameFormat("JaversAuditableAsync-%d")
            .build();
    return Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2, threadFactory);
}
```   

See the [full test case](https://github.com/javers/javers/blob/master/javers-spring/src/test/groovy/org/javers/spring/auditable/integration/JaversAuditableAspectAsyncIntegrationTest.groovy).
  
### 5.8.10
released on 2020-02-26
* [938](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/938)
  Fixed bug in custom TypeAdapters priorities.
  
### 5.8.9
released on 2020-02-07
* [935](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/935)
  Fixed `ClassCastException`: MissingProperty cannot be cast to java.lang.Double<br/>
  when using `CustomValueComparator`.
  
### 5.8.8
released on 2020-01-18
* [933](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/933)
  Extend Spring props to allow setting size or disabling the 
  latest snapshots cache for MongoDB.
  
```
javers:
  snapshotsCacheSize: 100
```  
  
### 5.8.7
released on 2019-12-13
* [921](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/921)
Added support for deleting by Id with the `@JaversAuditableDelete` aspect:

```java
@JaversAuditableDelete(entity = DummyEntity)
void deleteById(String id) {    
    ...
}
```

### 5.8.6
released on 2019-12-06
* [925](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/925)
  Fixed bug which caused `CustomValueComparator` not being invoked for `ZonedDateTime`.

### 5.8.5
released on 2019-11-10

* [910](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/910)
  Fixed `ConcurrentModificationException` in MongoDB `MapKeyDotReplacer`.

### 5.8.4
released on 2019-11-04

* [897](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/897)
 Added warning when `@TypeName` is used on a class without declaring its package name
 in `packagesToScan`. Improved javadocs for `TypeName` and `JaversBuilder.withPackagesToScan()`. 
 
```
07:12:58.253 [main] WARN  o.j.core.metamodel.type.UnknownType - Missing class definition with @TypeName 'Agreement', 
cant't properly deserialize its Snapshots from JaversRepository.
To fix this issue provide the fully-qualified package name of the class named 'Agreement' in the packagesToScan property.
``` 

### 5.8.3
released on 2019-11-02

* [878](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/878)
 Added property to disabling Global Id cache in SQL repository
 when using JaVers Spring Boot starter:
 
```
javers:
  sqlGlobalIdCacheDisabled: true
```

* [709](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/708)
 Added property to provide custom implementation of the `ObjectAccessHook`
 when using JaVers Spring Boot starter:
 
```
javers:
  objectAccessHook: com.example.MyObjectAccessHook
```

* [886](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/886) Fixed bug causing
`JsonSyntaxException`: Expected BEGIN_OBJECT but was STRING.
The exception was thrown on attempt to read Shadows with a ShallowReference with EmbeddedId
(a ShallowReference with an Id-property type mapped to Value Object). 

### 5.8.2
released on 2019-10-23

* [894](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/894) Better Shadows sorting.
 Using `SYNCHRONIZED_SEQUENCE` CommitId generator for distributed apps can cause duplicated `CommitId`.
 In this fix, Shadows sorting is unified to be
 based on `CommitDateInstant` for both CommitId generators.

* Removed throwing `CANT_SAVE_ALREADY_PERSISTED_COMMIT` in SQL repository. It was thrown
  only in some scenarios when `SYNCHRONIZED_SEQUENCE` generator was used, not ensuring
  the full protections against duplicated CommitId. <br/>
  After this fix, duplicated CommitIds when using `SYNCHRONIZED_SEQUENCE` generator
  are considered as not harmful (although not elegant).
  To ensure unique CommitIds for distributed apps 
  we recommend switching to `RANDOM` generator (when your app runs more than one Javers instance).

### 5.8.1
released on 2019-10-21

**Custom comparators reinvented**

Now, a **`CustomValueComparator`** has to implement the `toString(T value)` method,
which is used instead of `Object.hashCode()` when Values are compared in hashing contexts.
Thanks to that, Values with Custom comparators can be correctly compared anywhere, also when
they are Set items, Map keys or fields in Value Objects inside Sets. 
      
```java
public interface CustomValueComparator<T> {
     boolean equals(T a, T b);
     
     String toString(T value);
}
``` 

Existing method for registering Custom Value comparators
**<font color='red'>is deprecated</font>** and left only
for backward compatibility. Please switch to the new method. 

```java
/**
 * <b>Deprecated</b>, use {@link #registerValue(Class, CustomValueComparator)}.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Since this comparator is not aligned with {@link Object#hashCode()},
 * it calculates incorrect results when a given Value is used in hashing context
 * (when comparing Sets with Values or Maps with Values as keys).
 *
 * @see CustomValueComparator
 */
@Deprecated
public <T> JaversBuilder registerValue(Class<T> valueClass, BiFunction<T, T, Boolean> equalsFunction) {
    Validate.argumentsAreNotNull(valueClass, equalsFunction);

    return registerValue(valueClass, new CustomValueComparator<T>() {
        @Override
        public boolean equals(T a, T b) {
            return equalsFunction.apply(a,b);
        }

        @Override
        public String toString(@Nonnull T value) {
            return value.toString();
        }
    });
}
```     

The same applies to **`CustomPropertyComparator`**, it also have to implement
`toString(T value)` because it extends `CustomValueComparator`.
 
This is the **<font color='red'>breaking change</font>**,
if you are using a `CustomPropertyComparator` you have add `toString(T value)` implementation.

```java
public interface CustomPropertyComparator<T, C extends PropertyChange>
    extends CustomValueComparator<T> 
{
    Optional<C> compare(T left, T right, PropertyChangeMetadata metadata, Property property);
} 
```

Since this version, we stop recommending `CustomPropertyComparators` and Custom Types.
This warning is added to docs: 


    Custom Types are not easy to manage, use it as a last resort,<br/>
    only for corner cases like comparing custom Collection types.</b>
    
    In most cases, it's better to customize the Javers' diff algorithm using
    much more simpler `CustomValueComparator`.

See updated documentation of [Custom comparators](/documentation/diff-configuration/#custom-property-comparators).

### 5.7.7
released on 2019-10-03
* [888](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/888) Fixed bug

### 5.7.4
released on 2019-09-19
* [832](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/832) 
  Added possibility to use `CustomPropertyComparator` together with `ListCompareAlgorithm`.`AS_SET`.
  A custom `equals()` methods is used to compare two Lists without paying attention
  to ordering and duplicates. <b>Warning!</b> The list comparing algorithm would be slow in this case
  for large lists because it has n<sup>2</sup> complexity.

### 5.7.2
released on 2019-09-11

* [877](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/877) 
  Fixed issue with the `jv_snapshot` table primary key sequence for clustered applications.
  The *sequence allocation trick* for the `jv_snapshot` table is discontinued.
  To maintain backward compatibility, since this version,
  numbers genereted by the `jv_snapshot` primary key sequence are multiplied by 100.

### 5.7.0
released on 2019-09-03

* [870](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/870) 
  Added possibility to provide object-specific properties via
  [`CommitPropertiesProvider`]({{ site.github_spring_main_url }}/org/javers/spring/auditable/CommitPropertiesProvider.java).
  No-arg `provide()` is deprecated. These three methods are added:
  
  ```java 
    public interface CommitPropertiesProvider {
    
        default Map<String, String> provideForCommittedObject(Object domainObject) {
            return Collections.emptyMap();
        }
        
        default Map<String, String> provideForDeletedObject(Object domainObject) {
            return provideForCommittedObject(domainObject);
        }
        
        default Map<String, String> provideForDeleteById(Class<?> domainObjectClass, Object domainObjectId) {
            return Collections.emptyMap();
        }
      
        ...
  ``` 
  
### 5.6.3
released on 2019-08-02

* [864](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/864) 
  All Spring dependencies are updated. This update is forced by security vulnerability issues in `spring-security` 
  and `spring-data-jpa`.

* [860](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/860) 
  Fixed `SNAPSHOT_STATE_VIOLATION` exception when a getter was inherited both from a superclass and an interface.

* [774](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/774) 
  Added more descriptive message for `SNAPSHOT_STATE_VIOLATION` exception.
  
### 5.6.2
released on 2019-07-06

* [826](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/826) 
  Fixed bug in SQL JaversRepository when DB schema name was configured.
  The bug was causing: `Error on PostgreSQL: relation "jv_commit" already exists`.

### 5.6.1
released on 2019-07-01

* [855](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/855) 
  Fixed bug in `RANDOM` `CommitIdGenerator`.
  
### 5.6.0
released on 2019-06-13

* [694](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/694) 
  Added possibility in JaVers MongoDB starter
  to configure a dedicated Mongo database, which is used by Javers.
  See [JaversRepository configuration](/documentation/spring-boot-integration/#starter-repository-configuration).
  
* [775](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/775)
  Fixed issue: Spring Boot stops when SQL Schema Manager can't establish the connection.
  
* [851](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/851)
  Fixed exception: java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.javers.core.metamodel.property.MissingProperty cannot be cast to class java.util.List.

### 5.5.2
released on 2019-05-23

* [842](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/842) 
  Fixed bug in query with CommitId on Oracle.

### 5.5.1
released on 2019-05-18

* [839](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/839)  Fixed NPE in `OptionalType.items()`.

### 5.5.0
released on 2019-05-18

* <span style="color:red"><b>Breaking changes</b></span> in [CustomPropertyComparator](/documentation/diff-configuration/#custom-comparators)
  and constructors of all `PropertyChange` subclasses. `CustomPropertyComparator` interface is changed from:
  
  ```java 
  public interface CustomPropertyComparator<T, C extends PropertyChange> {
  
      Optional<C> compare(T left, T right, GlobalId affectedId, Property property);
            
      ...
  }
  ```
    
  to: 
  
  ```java 
  public interface CustomPropertyComparator<T, C extends PropertyChange> {
    
      Optional<C> compare(T left, T right, PropertyChangeMetadata metadata, Property property);
      
      ...
  }
  ```
  
  `PropertyChange` objects that are produced by comparators now accept `PropertyChangeMetadata` in constructors,
  for example:
  
  ```java
  public class CustomBigDecimalComparator implements CustomPropertyComparator<BigDecimal, ValueChange> {
  ...

  @Override
  public Optional<ValueChange> compare(BigDecimal left, BigDecimal right, PropertyChangeMetadata metadata, Property property)
  {
      if (equals(left, right)){
          return Optional.empty();
      }
 
      return Optional.of(new ValueChange(metadata, left, right));
  }

  ...
  }
  ```
  
* [830](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/830) & [834](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/834)
  Important new feature in [PropertyChange](https://github.com/javers/javers/blob/master/javers-core/src/main/java/org/javers/core/diff/changetype/PropertyChange.java).
  It gained the new enum, which allows to distinguish between ordinary `null` values
  and the case when a property is added/removed after refactoring:
  
   ```java
  /**
    * When two objects being compared have different classes,
    * they can have different sets of properties.
    * <br/>
    * When both objects have the same class, all changes have PROPERTY_VALUE_CHANGED type.
    */
   public enum PropertyChangeType {
   
       /**
        * When a property of the right object is absent in the left object.
        */
       PROPERTY_ADDED,
   
       /**
        * When a property of the left object is absent in the right object.
        */
       PROPERTY_REMOVED,
   
       /**
        * Regular value change &mdash; when a property is present in both objects.
        */
       PROPERTY_VALUE_CHANGED
   }
   
   ```  

  The new enum can be checked using these four new methods in `PropertyChange`:
  ```java
  public abstract class PropertyChange extends Change {
      ...
      
      public PropertyChangeType getChangeType() {
          return changeType;
      }
  
      public boolean isPropertyAdded() {
          return changeType == PropertyChangeType.PROPERTY_ADDED;
      }
  
      public boolean isPropertyRemoved() {
          return changeType == PropertyChangeType.PROPERTY_REMOVED;
      }
  
      public boolean isPropertyValueChanged() {
          return changeType == PropertyChangeType.PROPERTY_VALUE_CHANGED;
      }
  }
  ```

* [837](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/837)
 Fixed bug in SQL `JaversRepository` for Oracle and MS SQL databases.

### 5.4.0
released on 2019-05-11

* [625](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/625)
 Composite-Id is now available in JaVers. Multiple properties can be mapped with `@Id`,
 and the `localId` is constructed as a Map.
 
```groovy
    class Person {
        @Id String name
        @Id String surname
        @Id LocalDate dob
        int data
    }

    def "should support Composite Id assembled from Values"(){
        given:
        def first  = new Person(name: "mad", surname: "kaz", dob: LocalDate.of(2019,01,01), data: 1)
        def second = new Person(name: "mad", surname: "kaz", dob: LocalDate.of(2019,01,01), data: 2)

        when:
        javers.commit("author", first)
        javers.commit("author", second)
        def snapshot = javers.getLatestSnapshot(
                [
                    name: "mad",
                    surname: "kaz",
                    dob: LocalDate.of(2019,01,01)
                ],
                Person).get()

        then:
        snapshot.globalId.value().endsWith("Person/2019,1,1,mad,kaz")
        snapshot.globalId.cdoId == "2019,1,1,mad,kaz"
        snapshot.getPropertyValue("name") == "mad"
        snapshot.getPropertyValue("surname") == "kaz"
        snapshot.getPropertyValue("dob") == LocalDate.of(2019,01,01)
        snapshot.getPropertyValue("data") == 2
        snapshot.changed == ["data"]
    }
```

### 5.1.0
released on 2018-12-30

* [743](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/743) `commitDateInstant` added to `CommitMetadata`:

```java
/**
 * Commit creation timestamp in UTC.
 * <br/><br/>

 * to provide reliable chronological ordering, especially when {@link CommitIdGenerator#RANDOM}
 * is used.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Commits persisted by JaVers older then 5.1
 * have commitDateInstant guessed from commitDate and current {@link TimeZone}
 *
 * @since 5.1

public Instant getCommitDateInstant() {
    return commitMetadata.getCommitDateInstant();
}
```

* [761](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/761) Fixed `DateTimeParseException`

### <font color="red">5.0.0</font>
released on 2018-12-01

* JaVersâ€™ Spring integration modules are upgraded to be fully compatible with 
  **Spring 5.1** and **Spring Boot 2.1**.<br/>
  
  If you are using Spring 5.x,
  itâ€™s recommended to use JaVers 5.x. Otherwise you can fall into dependencies version conflict.<br/> 
  
  Current versions of dependencies:

```
springVersion            = 5.1.2.RELEASE
springBootVersion        = 2.1.0.RELEASE
springDataCommonsVersion = 2.1.2.RELEASE
springDataMongoVersion   = 2.1.2.RELEASE
springDataJPAVersion     = 2.1.2.RELEASE
springSecurityVersion    = 5.1.1.RELEASE
mongoDbDriverVersion     = 3.8.2
hibernateVersion         = 5.3.7.Final   
```

  Since now, the last JaVers version compatible with **Spring 4** is 3.14.0.   

* [747](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/747)
  Two **breaking changes** in `CustomPropertyComparator`. Now, it has to 
  implement `boolean equals(a, b)` method, which is used by JaVers 
  to calculate collection-to-collection diff.
  Return type of `compare(...)` method is changed to `Optional`.
  See updated [examples and doc](/documentation/diff-configuration/#custom-comparators). 
              
```java
public interface CustomPropertyComparator<T, C extends PropertyChange> {
    /**
     * This comparator is called by JaVers to calculate property-to-property diff.
     */
    Optional<C> compare(T left, T right, GlobalId affectedId, Property property);

    /**
     * This comparator is called by JaVers to calculate collection-to-collection diff.
     */
    boolean equals(T a, T b);
}

```  

* [746](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/746) 
  Added default comparator for raw `Collections`. Previously, raw `Collections` were ignored by JaVers,
  now, they are converted to Lists and then compared as Lists. 
  
* [738](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/738)
  Added `DBRefUnproxyObjectAccessHook` to support lazy `@DBRef` from Spring Data MongoDB.
  The hook is registered automatically in `javers-spring-boot-starter-mongo`.

### 3.14.0
released on 2018-11-10 

* All SQL queries are rewritten using the new, faster JaVers SQL framework.
  Poly JDBC is no longer used for queries (but is still used to schema management).
  Thanks to that, **performance of JaVers commits with SQL repo is significantly better**,
  especially when committing large object graphs.
     
* Experimental support for DB2 and DB2400 is discontinued.

### 3.12.4
released on 2018-10-27 

* [690](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/690) Fixed &mdash; missing property in *.yml to set SQL database schema name. 


### 3.12.3
released on 2018-10-25 

* [688](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/688) Fixed &mdash; missing property in *.yml to set CommitIdGenerator. 

### 3.12.1
released on 2018-10-19 

* [724](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/724) Fixed issue when deserializing Diff from JSON. 

### 3.12.0
released on 2018-10-19 

* [593](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/593) Asynchronous commit:

```
CompletableFuture<Commit> commitAsync(String author, Object currentVersion, Executor executor);
```

### 3.11.7
released on 2018-10-11

* [723](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/723)
Added possibility to load Snapshots even if user's class is removed. 
Prevents JaversException TYPE_NAME_NOT_FOUND.

### 3.11.6
released on 2018-09-29

* [712](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/712) Fixed issue with
auto-audit aspect for JPA CRUD repositories for entities with Id generated 
by Hibernate (`@GeneratedValue`).

### 3.11.5
released on 2018-09-19

* [717](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/717) Added index on `global_id` SQL table to speed up
queries by Value Object ID.  

### 3.11.4
released on 2018-08-27

* [705](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/705) Dependency update. FastClasspathScanner updated to the latest ClassGraph. 

### 3.11.3
released on 2018-08-22
* Fixed JaversException PROPERTY_NOT_FOUND
  reported [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51634751/javersexception-property-not-found-property-in-derived-class-not-found-in-abstr).
  
* Fixed bugs in Maps and Multimaps serialization.   

### 3.11.2
released on 2018-08-14
* [697](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/697) Fixed issue with Numbers.

### 3.11.1
released on 2018-08-09
* [692](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/692) Guava issue is finally fixed.

### 3.11.0
released on 2018-08-04

* [511](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/511)
 Added handling of property type changes in domain classes.
 Now JaVers is able to load a Snapshot from JaversRepository,
 even if property types are different in a current domain class. 
  
* [692](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/692)
 Fixed bug in javers-core dependencies. Guava is a truly optional dependency.   

### 3.10.2
released on 2018-07-10

* [687](https://github.com/javers/javers/pull/687)
  Additional advices for Spring Data Jpa Aspect.

released on 2018-07-07

* [682](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/682) 
  Fixed JaVers bootstrap error &mdash;
  COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND: JaVers bootstrap error - component of type 'org.javers.core.CommitIdGenerator'

### 3.10.0
released on 2018-06-22

* **Stream API for Shadow queries** &mdash; `javers.findShadowsAndStream()`.
  Using `Stream.skip()` and `Stream.limit()` is the only correct way for paging Shadows
  (see [658](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/658)).
  See the example in [ShadowStreamExample.java](https://github.com/javers/javers/blob/master/javers-core/src/test/java/org/javers/core/examples/ShadowStreamExample.java).
  
```
Stream<Shadow<Employee>> shadows = javers.findShadowsAndStream(
        QueryBuilder.byInstanceId("Frodo", Employee.class).build());

//then
Employee employeeV5 = shadows.filter(shadow -> shadow.getCommitId().getMajorId() == 5)
       .map(shadow -> shadow.get())
       .findFirst().orElse(null);
```
  

* [650](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/650)
  `@DiffIgnore` and `@DiffInclude` annotations can mixed now in one class.
  When `@DiffInclude` is used in a class, JaVers ignores `@DiffIgnore` or `@Transient` annotations in that class. 

### 3.9.7
released on 2018-05-17

* [677](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/677) Added support for `saveAll(Iterable)` from Spring Data 2.x

released on 2018-04-22

* [660](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/660) Fixed bug in Shadow query runner.

### 3.9.1
released on 2018-04-19

* [657](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/657)
  Fixed implementaton of `RANDOM` [`CommitIdGenerator`]({{ site.github_core_main_url }}org/javers/core/CommitIdGenerator.java).
  You can use it in distributed applications:   
  
```java
Javers javers = javers().withCommitIdGenerator(CommitIdGenerator.RANDOM)
                        .build();
```

### 3.9.0
released on 2018-04-11

* New API for processing Changes, convenient for formatting a change log. 
Now you can group changes by commits and by objects. 
See [`Changes.groupByCommit()`]({{ site.github_core_main_url }}org/javers/core/Changes.java).
For example:

```java
Changes changes = javers.findChanges(QueryBuilder.byClass(Employee.class)
        .withNewObjectChanges().build());
     
changes.groupByCommit().forEach(byCommit -> {
  System.out.println("commit " + byCommit.getCommit().getId());
  byCommit.groupByObject().forEach(byObject -> {
    System.out.println("  changes on " + byObject.getGlobalId().value() + " : ");
    byObject.get().forEach(change -> {
      System.out.println("  - " + change);
    });
  });
});
```

* Fixed bug in `queryForChanges()`, which could cause NPE in some corner cases.
Especially, for complex graphs with multiple levels of nested Value Objects.

[Ismael Gomes Costa](https://github.com/ismaelgomescosta)
contributed the method for registering `toString` function for complex `ValueTypes` used as Entity Id.
See javadoc for [`JaversBuilder.registerValueWithCustomToString()`]({{ site.github_core_main_url }}org/javers/core/JaversBuilder.java). 

### 3.7.5
released on 2017-12-01

* **Shadow queries performance optimization**. Less DB queries executed for 
each **Deep+** query.

* Changes in Shadow Scopes. Now, JaVers always loads child ValueObjects owned by selected Entities.
So there is no need to call `QueryBuilder.withChildValueObjects()`.
See javadoc for [`ShadowScope`]({{ site.github_core_main_url }}org/javers/repository/jql/ShadowScope.java). 

* Shadow queries execution statistics logger. Enable it: 

```
    <logger name="org.javers.JQL" level="DEBUG"/>
```      

and you will get detailed logs from query execution, for example: 

```text
DEBUG org.javers.JQL - SHALLOW query: 1 snapshots loaded (entities: 1, valueObjects: 0)
DEBUG org.javers.JQL - DEEP_PLUS query for '...SnapshotEntity/2' at commitId 3.0, 1 snapshot(s) loaded, gaps filled so far: 1
DEBUG org.javers.JQL - warning: object '...SnapshotEntity/3' is outside of the DEEP_PLUS+1 scope, references to this object will be nulled. Increase maxGapsToFill and fill all gaps in your object graph.
DEBUG org.javers.JQL - queryForShadows executed:
JqlQuery {
  IdFilter{ globalId: ...SnapshotEntity/1 }
  QueryParams{ aggregate: true, limit: 100 }
  ShadowScopeDefinition{ shadowScope: DEEP_PLUS, maxGapsToFill: 1 }
  Stats{
    executed in millis: 12
    DB queries: 2
    all snapshots: 2
    SHALLOW snapshots: 1
    DEEP_PLUS snapshots: 1
    gaps filled: 1
    gaps left!: 1
  }
}
```

Statistics are also available in `Stats` object that you can get from
an executed query:
 
```java
Stats stats = jqlQuery.stats();
```

### 3.7.0
released on 2017-11-24

* [605](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/605) Compare Lists as Sets.
  New List comparing algorithm contributed by [drakin](https://github.com/drakin).
  See [List comparing algorithms](/documentation/diff-configuration/#list-algorithms)

* [601](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/601)
  Fixed bug in the type mapping algorithm. In this case, an Entity with complex inheritance structure
  was mapped as Value.  

### 3.6.3
released on 2017-11-13

* Changes in Shadow Scopes. **Commit-deep+** is renamed to **Deep+**. 
  See javadoc for [`ShadowScope`]({{ site.github_core_main_url }}org/javers/repository/jql/ShadowScope.java).
  Now, deep+ scope doesn't include commit-deep scope. They are independent scopes.

* [597](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/597)
  Second fix for MySQL error: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes.
    
### 3.6.2
released on 2017-11-01

* New `SnapshotType` filter in JQL.
  Allows selecting snapshots by type: `INITIAL`, `UPDATE`, `TERMINAL`. See
  `QueryBuilder.withSnapshotType()`.

* Improved exception handling in `byInstance` query.

### 3.6.1
released on 2017-10-29

* Fix for ValueObject loading in Shadow queries.
See [updated docs of Shadow scopes](/documentation/jql-examples/#shadow-scopes). 

### 3.6.0
released on 2017-10-05

* [431](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/431)
 Auto-audit aspect also on [JpaRepository.saveAndFlush()](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html).
 
<span style="color:red">This task forced a major refactoring</span>.

`Javers-spring` module was split into two parts:
 
* `javers-spring` with general purpose auto-audit aspect and
  auto-audit aspect for Spring Data CrudRepository.
* `javers-spring-jpa` &mdash; a superset of `javers-spring` &mdash; with
   JPA & Hibernate integration, so:
   auto-audit aspect for Spring Data JpaRepository,
   HibernateUnproxyObjectAccessHook, JpaHibernateConnectionProvider,
   and JaversTransactionalDecorator.
   
If you are using <span style="color:red">JaVers with MongoDB</span>, you don't need to change anything.

If you are using <span style="color:red">JaVers with SQL</span> but without Spring Boot,
you need to change the `javers-spring` dependency to `javers-spring-jpa`.
If you are using Spring Boot with our starter (`javers-spring-boot-starter-sql`), 
you don't need to change anything. Our starters always provide the right configuration. 

### 3.5.2
released on 2017-10-05 <br/>

* [574](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/574)
 Added missing support for `@PropertyName` in Shadows.

### 3.5.1
released on 2017-09-24 <br/>

* Dependencies versions update:

```
springVersion=4.3.11.RELEASE
springBootVersion=1.5.7.RELEASE

```

### 3.5.0
released on 2017-07-30 <br/>

* [568](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/568)
 Added the new scope for Shadow queries &mdash; <b>commit-depth+</b>.
 In this scope, JaVers tries to restore an original object graph
 with (possibly) all object references resolved.
 See [Shadow Scopes](/documentation/jql-examples/#shadow-scopes).

### 3.3.5
released on 2017-07-14 <br/>
                       
* [565](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/565)
 Fixed error when executing query byInstance with HibernateUnproxyObjectAccessHook. 

### 3.3.4
released on 2017-07-04 <br/>
                       
* [560](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/560)
 Fixed NPE when getting empty list of Shadows.

### 3.3.3
released on 2017-06-29 <br/>
                       
* [548](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/548)
 Added support for classes generated by Google [@AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value).

### 3.3.2
released on 2017-06-25 <br/>
                       
* [546](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/546)
 Arrays on Value position are now compared using `Arrays.equals()`.

### 3.3.1
released on 2017-06-25 <br/>
                       
* [497](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/497)
 Fix in PolyJDBC for MsSql, deprecated `TEXT` column type changed to `VARCHAR(MAX)` 

### 3.3.0
released on 2017-06-21 at Devoxx PL, Cracow <br/>

* Added possibility to register
 a [`CustomValueComparator`]({{ site.github_core_main_url }}org/javers/core/diff/custom/CustomValueComparator.java)
 function for comparing ValueTypes
 (it works also for Values stored in Lists, Arrays and Maps).
 Solved issues: [492](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/492),
                [531](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/531).
 
 For example, BigDecimals are (by default) ValueTypes
 compared using `BigDecimal.equals()`.
 Now, you can compare them in the smarter way, ignoring trailing zeros:
 
```java 
 javersBuilder.registerValue(BigDecimal.class, (a,b) -> a.compareTo(b) == 0);
```

### 3.2.1
released on 2017-06-12 <br/>

  See [Shadow query examples](/documentation/jql-examples#query-for-shadows). 

* [455](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/455)
 Fixed error in schema creation on MySQL database with non UTF-8 encoding &mdash;
 MySQL error: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes 

### 3.1.1
released on 2017-05-07 <br/>

* [532](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/532)
 Added the method to clear sequence allocation in PolyJDBC.
 See JaversSqlRepository<wbr/>evictSequenceAllocationCache().
 
* [539](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/539)

 Now, Javers' annotations have priority over JPA annotations. 

### 3.1.0
released on 2017-03-27 <br/>

* [403](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/403)
 Added `@PropertyName` annotation.
 Now, property names can be customized which means easier domain classes refactoring.

* [27](https://github.com/polyjdbc/polyjdbc/issues/27)
 Fixed resource leak in PolyJDBC.

### 3.0.5
released on 2017-03-24 <br/>

### <font color="red">3.0.0 &mdash; Java 8 release</font>
released on 2017-02-01 <br/>

**We rewrote whole JaVers' code base from Java 7 to 8.**<br/>
  Now, JaVers is lighter, faster, and more friendly for Java 8 users.  
  
**Breaking changes**
  
* All javers-core classes like:
 `Change`, `Commit`, or `CdoSnapshot` now use 
 standard Java 8 types `java.util.Optional` and `java.time.LocalDateTime`.
 
* The old good Joda Time is no longer used in javers-core but still supported in usersâ€™ objects.

* JaVersâ€™ `Optional` is removed.
  
* All `@Deprecated` methods in public API are removed.  
  
* **Since 3.0, JaVers is not runnable on Java 7 Runtime.**
  If you still use Java 7, stay with {{site.javers_java7_version}} version,
  which will be maintained for a while, but only for bug fixing.  

Misc 

* All JaVersâ€™ dependencies are bumped to the latest versions:
  
```
gson :                   2.8.0
mongo-java-driver :      3.4.2

guava :                  21.0  (optional)

```  

* SQL Repository schema migration scripts for JaVers 1.x are removed.
  Upgrade from JaVers 1.x to 3.0 is still possible,
  but first run 2.9.x to perform overdue SQL Repository schema migration.

### 3.0.0-RC

  Added support in `javers-spring` for multiple Spring Transaction Managers. <br/>
  Since now, `transactionManager` bean should be explicitly provided 
  when configuring `javers` bean:
  
```java
    @Bean
    public Javers javers(PlatformTransactionManager txManager) {
        JaversSqlRepository sqlRepository = SqlRepositoryBuilder
                .sqlRepository()
                .withConnectionProvider(jpaConnectionProvider())
                .withDialect(DialectName.H2)
                .build();

        return TransactionalJaversBuilder
                .javers()
                .withTxManager(txManager)
                .withObjectAccessHook(new HibernateUnproxyObjectAccessHook())

* [#417](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/417)
  Fixed dependency management in `javers-spring`.
  Now `spring-data-commons` dependency is optional
  and should be on an application's classpath only when you are using the `@JaversSpringDataAuditable` annotation.
  <br/>
  The aspect class `JaversAuditableRepositoryAspect` was removed and split into two aspects:
  `JaversAuditableAspect` and `JaversSpringDataAuditableRepositoryAspect`.
  <br/>
  First one should be enabled when you are using `@JaversAuditable`.
  Second one should be enabled when you are using `@JaversSpringDataAuditable`.
  <br/>
  If you are using `javers-spring-boot-starter-*`,
  both aspects are enabled by default so you donâ€™t have to change anything.
  <br/>
  See [auto-audit aspects documentaton](/documentation/spring-integration#auto-audit-aspect).

### <font color="red">2.0.0</font>
released on 2016-06-09 <br/>

JaVers 2.0 comes with major improvements and new features in JQL.

**Unified semantics of changes and snapshot queries** <br/>
In JaVers 2.0, change queries work in the same way as snapshot queries
and change queries accept all filters.

For example, in JaVers 1.x, this change query:

```
javers.findChanges(QueryBuilder.byInstanceId(Person.class,1).withVersion(5).build());
```

returns empty list, which is not very useful.

In JaVers 2.0 this query returns changes introduced by the selected snapshot,
so changes between versions 4 and 5 of a given object.

JaVers implements change queries on the top of snapshot queries.
Change sets are recalculated as a difference between subsequent pairs of snapshots fetched from
a JaversRepository.
In 1.x, only explicitly selected snapshots are involved in the recalculation algorithm.
In 2.0, for each snapshot selected by a user query, JaVers implicitly fetches *previous* snapshot (if needed).
Thanks to that, change queries are far more useful and they work as you could expect.

**New features**<br/>

* New query for any domain object.
See [any domain object query example](/documentation/jql-examples#any-domain-object-query).

* [#334](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/334)
New JQL `author()` filter.
See [author filter example](/documentation/jql-examples#author-filter).

* [#305](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/305)
New JQL `commitProperty()` filter.
See [commit property filter example](/documentation/jql-examples#commit-property-filter).

* [#375](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues/375) Added support for commit properties in auto-audit aspect.
See [CommitPropertiesProvider](/documentation/spring-integration#commit-properties-provider-bean).

**SQL Schema migration**<br/>

JaVers 2.0 comes with the new database schema for SQL repository:

* table `jv_cdo_class` is no longer used
* new column `jv_global_id.type_name`
* new column `jv_snapshot.managed_name`
* new table `jv_commit_property`

JaVers automatically launches a data migration script when old schema is detected.
Data from `jv_cdo_class` are copied to new columns (`jv_global_id.type_name` and `jv_snapshot.managed_name`).
It should take a few seconds for medium size tables but for very large tables it could be time consuming.

**Breaking changes**<br/>
The only one breaking change is new semantics of changes query which is actually an improvement.

If you are using SQL repository, and your `jv_snapshot` table is large (millions of records),
run JaVers 2.0 on your test environment for the first time and check if data migrations is done correctly.
